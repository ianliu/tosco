ToSCo is a set of scientific computing programs, mainly for processing geophysical data.

This project is associated to **GêBR** project. More about of GêBR is available at [GêBR Projet site](http://www.gebrproject.com).

This project hosts programs which can be used from GêBR, taking care of porting and easily back distributing them to the community. That is a way to expand GêBR's abilities. Anyone can contribute programs to ToSCo.

Programs in ToSCo are packed for most widely-used Linux flavors and distributed directly and through GêBR Live DVD.
